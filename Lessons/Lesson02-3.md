## 2.3 Markdown with Task (Assignment #2 due by 3/17)

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed for easy readability and formatting. It uses simple syntax like # for headers, * for emphasis, and [link](URL) for hyperlinks, allowing users to create structured documents with plain text.

### Step 1: üê£ Practice first on your README.md file

This is the file you've made when you created a repository (Remember checking 'Add a README file')  
_Note:_ If you haven't created a readme.md file when you made 'Practice' repository, then you can create one now.

* Go to your Github account and Sign in (with your Google account)
* Go to the repository 'Practice' > README.md or readme.md
* You can see an edit icon on the page (see below)
* To save, click "Commit changes" on the top right.

**Note:** You will learn about the Markdown language bit by bit as necessary when relevant topics come up. For now, let's just briefly introduce what the Markdown language and README files (with the .md extension) are, and practice that.

### Step 2: üê£ Task to complete

1. **Referring to the manual below, create Assign02.md file in your 'Practice' repository and edit the file exactly as shown in [this link](https://github.com/MK316/Coding4ET/blob/main/Lessons/markdown-sample.md).**
2. **This assignment should be completed collaboratively with group members, but each member must complete the assignment individually as well.**
3. **You're allowed to copy text from the link. (due by 3/17)**

## üìó Markdown Manual for Beginners
Welcome to the Markdown Manual for Beginners! Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world‚Äôs most popular markup languages.

Using Markdown, you can format words as bold or italic, add images, create lists, and more‚Äîall with plain text. This guide will introduce you to the basics of Markdown, providing you with the tools to start creating formatted text documents.

## 1. Why Use Markdown?
+ Simplicity: Markdown is easy to learn and use.
+ Portability: Markdown files are plain text, so they're compatible with any text editor and operating system.
+ Flexibility: You can convert Markdown to HTML, PDF, and other formats.

## 2. Basic Syntax
### Headings
Headings from h1 through h6 are produced by adding # before the heading text. The number of # symbols before the text represents the depth of the heading. For example:

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

```

### Emphasis
You can make text bold or italic.

#### Bold: Wrap text with two asterisks (**) or underscores (__).

```
**This text is bold**
__This text is also bold__

```

#### _Italic:_ Wrap text with one asterisk (*) or underscore (_).

```
*This text is italic*
_This text is also italic_
```

#### Lists
Markdown supports ordered (numbered) and unordered (bulleted) lists.

+  Unordered Lists: Start lines with a dash (-), asterisk (*), or plus sign (+).

```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```
+ Ordered Lists: Start lines with numbers followed by a period.
```
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

#### Links
To create a link, wrap the link text in brackets ([ ]), and then wrap the link URL in parentheses (( )).

```

```

#### Images
To add an image, start with an exclamation mark (!), followed by the alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image in parentheses.
```
![This is an image](/path/to/image.jpg)
```

#### Blockquotes
To create a blockquote, start a line with a greater-than sign (>).

```
> This is a blockquote.
```

#### Code
You can display inline code by wrapping text in backticks ( ), or create a code block by wrapping text in three backticks or indenting it with four spaces.

+ Inline Code:
```
`This is inline code`
```

+ Code Blcok:
```markdown

```
This is a code block
```
```

#### Horizontal lines
To create a horizontal line, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or underscores (___).

```
---
```

## 3. Advanced Formatting
### Tables
Create tables by separating headers and columns with dashes (-) and pipes (|).

```
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     | Data     |
```
The above displays like this:

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     | Data     |


### Task Lists
To create a task list, start items with a dash and a space, followed by [ ] for an incomplete task or [x] for a completed task.

```

## Practice Makes Perfect
The best way to learn Markdown is by practice. Try using Markdown to format your notes, write blog posts, or document your projects. As you become more comfortable with the syntax, you'll find that Markdown is an invaluable tool for writing on the web.




[üîù](#Lesson-2-Getting-Ready)



[^1]: **Markdown (or Markdown language)** is a simple way of writing formatted text using plain text. It's popular because it's easy to learn and use. Imagine you're writing a normal text document, but you can also add some special symbols to make certain words bold, create lists, or even add links and pictures.

For example, if you want to make a word bold, you wrap it in double asterisks, like this: **bold**. If you want to create a list, you just start lines with dashes or numbers. And to add a link, you put the text you want to show in square brackets and the web address in parentheses right after it.

The great thing about Markdown is that it's meant to be as easy to read in its plain text form as it is in its formatted form. It's widely used in many websites and tools, like GitHub and Reddit, for writing comments, instructions, and more. For beginners, it's a friendly way to start adding some style to your text without needing to know any complex coding or web design techniques.
