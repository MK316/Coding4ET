## 2.3 Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language designed for easy readability and formatting. It uses simple syntax like # for headers, * for emphasis, and [link](URL) for hyperlinks, allowing users to create structured documents with plain text.

üê£ Practice on your README.md file

This is the file you've made when you created a repository (Remember checking 'Add a README file')

* Go to your Github account and Sign in (with your Google account)
* Go to the repository 'Practice' > README.md
* You can see an edit icon on the page (see below)

**Note:** You will learn about the Markdown language bit by bit as necessary when relevant topics come up. For now, let's just briefly introduce what the Markdown language and README files (with the .md extension) are, and practice that.

**üìçInstruction: Try the following conventions in your README.md file.**

**üìçInstruction: Try this. Write texts as appearing on the left, and save it ("Commit changes"), then you'll see the formatted text on the right.

Examples (below):

## Heading Level 1 (Biggest Size)

To create the biggest heading, you use one hash symbol (#) followed by a space, and then your heading text.

## Heading Level 2 (Second Biggest Size)

For a slightly smaller heading, use two hash symbols (##) followed by a space.

### Heading Level 3 (Medium Size)

Use three hash symbols (###) for an even smaller heading.

[^1]: **Markdown (or Markdown language)** is a simple way of writing formatted text using plain text. It's popular because it's easy to learn and use. Imagine you're writing a normal text document, but you can also add some special symbols to make certain words bold, create lists, or even add links and pictures.

For example, if you want to make a word bold, you wrap it in double asterisks, like this: **bold**. If you want to create a list, you just start lines with dashes or numbers. And to add a link, you put the text you want to show in square brackets and the web address in parentheses right after it.

The great thing about Markdown is that it's meant to be as easy to read in its plain text form as it is in its formatted form. It's widely used in many websites and tools, like GitHub and Reddit, for writing comments, instructions, and more. For beginners, it's a friendly way to start adding some style to your text without needing to know any complex coding or web design techniques.
