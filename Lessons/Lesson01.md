# Lesson 1 Introduction

### What is Python?

Python is a **high-level programming language** known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for beginners as well as experienced developers. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes **code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.**

* High-level programming language (cf. Low-level programming language) - A high-level programming language is user-friendly, using natural language elements, making it easier to learn and write code compared to more complex, low-level languages.
* [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/)
* Readability: Python is designed to be easy to understand and read, almost like reading English. This is achieved through a clean and straightforward syntax. The focus on readability makes Python an excellent language for beginners and also simplifies collaboration and maintenance in larger projects.

* Significant Whitespace: In many programming languages, code blocks (like loops, if statements, functions) are defined by symbols such as braces {}. In Python, however, indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) is used to define these blocks. This approach forces Python programmers to write neatly formatted code, which enhances the overall readability. Using whitespace? (Examples below)

* Benefits of Readability and Significant Whitespace:

  * Ease of Learning and Use: New programmers can read and grasp Python code more easily compared to many other languages. This ease of understanding accelerates learning.
  * Error Reduction: Clean and consistent formatting helps in identifying errors, such as missing or extra indentations, which might lead to incorrect block definitions.
  * Focus on Problem-Solving: With a syntax that's close to English and less cluttered with symbols, programmers can focus more on solving the problem rather than on understanding the syntax.
