## Comments vs codes

In Google Colab, cells can contain either code or comments. Code cells are used for writing and executing Python code. When you run a code cell, Colab processes the Python code and displays the output. Comments, on the other hand, are non-executable lines in the code, used for explaining or annotating the code for better understanding. In Python, comments are created by preceding text with a # symbol; anything following # on the line is ignored by the Python interpreter. This helps in making the code more readable and maintainable.

For example,

```
# This is a comment line <= This is a comment line

print("Hello, Python!") # this is a code line
```

Here's another example:

```
# This is a comment line <= This is a comment line
# Comments can be more than one line

print("Hello, Python!") # This is a code line
print('This is the output') # Comment can also be written this way.
```

## Input vs Output

Before diving into coding and digital literacy, it's essential to understand the basic concepts of input and output, as these are fundamental to how computers and digital systems work.

![](https://github.com/MK316/Coding4ET/raw/main/images/inputoutput.png)

### Input:

Definition: Input refers to any information or data that is sent to a computer for processing. This information can come from various sources, such as a keyboard, mouse, microphone, or even an internet connection.
Examples:
+ Typing text on a keyboard.
+ Clicking or moving a mouse.
+ Speaking into a microphone.
+ Uploading a file or entering data through a website.
+ Importance in Coding: Understanding input is crucial because it determines how a program will respond or behave. For instance, a program might react differently to a click than it would to a keyboard press.

### Output:

Definition: Output is the result produced by a computer after processing the input. This output can be displayed in various forms like text on a screen, sound through speakers, or even a printed document.
Examples:
+ Displaying text or images on a screen.
+ Playing sound or music through speakers or headphones.
+ Sending a document to a printer.
+ Saving a file or sending data over the internet.
+ Importance in Coding: Output is the way a program communicates the results of its computations or actions. It can be as simple as displaying a message like "Hello World!" or as complex as rendering a detailed graphical report.

Understanding these concepts is a stepping stone to digital literacy, as they are integral to how digital devices operate. When learning to code, you'll often think in terms of what input your code needs and what output it should produce. This forms the basis of writing effective and user-friendly programs.

## In Google Colab when coding with Python, input and output are fundamental concepts:

### Input:

+ **User Input:** Python's input() function is used to capture input from the user. When input() is called, the execution pauses and waits for the user to enter some text. After pressing Enter, the text is returned as a string and can be stored in a variable.
+ **File Input:** Colab supports reading from and writing to files. You can upload files from your computer or read files from Google Drive. Python's file handling functions (open(), read(), write(), etc.) are used for this purpose.

External Data Sources: Colab can also interact with databases, APIs, and other external data sources using appropriate Python libraries.

### Output:

+ **Displaying Results:** The simplest way to output data in Colab is using the print() function, which displays the specified message or variable value in the output cell.
+ **Visual Output:** For data visualization, libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn can be used. Colab directly supports the display of plots and charts generated by these libraries in the output cell.
+ **File Output:** You can write data to files, which can then be downloaded to your local system or saved to Google Drive.
+ **Interactive Widgets[^1]:** Colab also supports interactive widgets like sliders, buttons, and text boxes, allowing dynamic output based on user interaction within the notebook.

The combination of these input and output methods makes Colab a versatile tool for Python programming, especially for data analysis, machine learning, and educational purposes.

## Operators

Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. They are essential for manipulating values and creating expressions.

+ Assign (=): Assigns the right side's value to the left side operand. Example: x = y, x = 3, y = "Apple", z = "an", k = z + y, etc.

### 1. Types of Operators

Python operators can be classified into several categories:

### A. Arithmetic Operators** 

+ Addition (+): Adds two operands. Example: x + y
+ Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand. Example: x - y
+ Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands. Example: x * y
+ Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand. Example: x / y
+ Modulus (%): Returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand. Example: x % y
+ Exponentiation (**): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand. Example: x ** y
+ Floor Division (//): Divides and returns the integer part of the quotient. Ignores the digits after the decimal point. Example: x // y

### B. Comparison Operators

+ Equal (==): True if both operands are equal. Example: x == y
**Note that a single equal sign (=) is used in Python to assign a value to a variable: x = 3  
+ Not Equal (!=): True if operands are not equal. Example: x != y
+ Greater than (>): True if the left operand is greater than the right operand. Example: x > y
+ Less than (<): True if the left operand is less than the right operand. Example: x < y
+ Greater than or equal to (>=): True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. Example: x >= y
+ Less than or equal to (<=): True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. Example: x <= y

### C. Logical Operators

+ And (and): True if both operands are true. Example: x and y
+ Or (or): True if either of the operands is true. Example: x or y
+ Not (not): True if the operand is false (complements the operand). Example: not x

## Variables

### 1. What is a Variable?

In Python, a variable is a container for storing data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable; a variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

**Characteristics of Python Variables:** 

+ Dynamically Typed: Python automatically identifies the data type of a variable based on the type of its value, which means you don‚Äôt have to explicitly declare the data type of a variable.
+ Mutable: The value of a variable can be changed after it is created.
+ **Naming Rules:**
    + Must start with a letter or the underscore character (_).
    + Cannot start with a number.
    + Can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ ).
    + Case-sensitive (age, Age, and AGE are three different variables).

### 2. Creating Variables

To create a variable in Python, you just need to assign a value to a name:

```
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"

print(x)
print(y)
```
Here, x is a variable of type int, and y is a variable of type str (string).

### 3. Variable Types

Python has various data types including:

+ Integers (int): Whole numbers like 3, 300, -219.
+ Floating Point (float): Numbers with a decimal point like 2.3, 3.14, -0.001.
+ Strings (str): Ordered sequence of characters like "Hello", "World123", "Python!".
+ Boolean (bool): Represents True or False.

### 4. Best Practices

+ [1] Variable Names: Use meaningful variable names to make your code more readable.

For example,

**Poor Practice:**

```
a = 50
b = 120
c = a * b
```
In this example, a, b, and c are not descriptive. It's hard to understand what these variables represent without context.

**Good Practice:**

```
room_length = 50
room_width = 120
room_area = room_length * room_width
```
Here, the variable names clearly indicate what they represent, making the code more readable and understandable.

+ [2] Consistency: Stick to a naming convention, like snake_case (e.g., my_variable).
+ [3] Avoid Globals: Try not to use global variables unless necessary. They can make the debugging process difficult.

Global and local variables are two fundamental concepts in Python programming (and programming in general), relating to the scope of variables. Understanding their differences is crucial for managing how data is stored and modified in your programs.

**Global variables**
+ Definition: A global variable is declared outside of all functions. This means it is accessible from any part of the program, including inside functions.
+ Scope: Global scope ‚Äì accessible anywhere in the program.

**Local Variables**
Definition: A local variable is declared inside a function. It is only accessible within that function and not outside of it.
Scope: Local scope ‚Äì accessible only within the function where it is declared.

+ [4] Comments: Use comments to describe complex operations or reasons behind choosing certain variable names.

### 5. Example: Basic Variables in Colab

Here‚Äôs a simple example to demonstrate creating and using variables in a Colab notebook:

```
# Cell 1: Creating Variables
name = "John Doe"
age = 30
height = 5.9
is_student = False
```

```
# Cell 2: Working with Variables
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age}")
print(f"Height: {height} feet")
print(f"Is a student: {is_student}")
```
When you run these cells, you will see the output displayed under the cell, as follows:

> Name: John Doe  
> Age: 30  
> Height: 5.9 feet  
> Is a student: False  

```
# Cell 3: Changing Variable Value
age = 31
print(f"Updated Age: {age}")
```
> Updated Age: 31  

This example demonstrates creating variables, printing their values, and updating a variable.

## Functions


[üîù](#Lesson-3-Coding-Basics)

## Module-library-package

**Modules:** Think of a module as a single file containing Python code. It might contain functions, variables, and classes which you can use once you import this module into your own code. It's like a toolbox that has a specific set of tools you can use.

**Packages:** A package is a collection of Python modules under a common namespace. This usually means they are in the same folder and are related to each other in some way. You can think of a package as a bigger toolbox that holds several smaller toolboxes (modules). 

**Libraries:** A library is a more general term that refers to a collection of packages and modules. It's like a big bookshelf where you store all kinds of toolboxes and individual tools. You can import these libraries into your programs and use the functions and classes that they offer. Sometimes people use 'library' and 'package' interchangeably.

In summary, a module is a single file, a package is a collection of these files, and a library is a collection of packages and modules. They all help you to leverage existing code for your own projects, making programming in Python much more efficient and powerful.

## üê• Import or install packages
To demonstrate how to import a package and pick a random number from 1 to 10 in Python, you can use the random module. This module is a part of the standard Python library, so you don't need to install anything extra. Here's a simple example:

```
# Generate a random number between 1 and 10

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)

print("The random number is:", random_number)
```

## Examine the differences

Variable at the end vs. print(variable)

```
# Code 1

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)

random_number
```

```
# Code 2

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)

random_number
print(random_number)
```

```
# Code 3

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)

print(random_number)
random_number
```

```
# Code 4

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)

print("random_number:", random_number)
```

```
# Code 5

random_number = random.randint(1, 10)

print("The random number is: ", random_number)
```

[^1]: Widgets: Widgets in Python, particularly in the context of creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs), are fundamental elements that enable interaction with the user. Widgets make it possible for users to input data, make choices, and interact with the application in a more intuitive and visual way, compared to text-based input/output in a console.
