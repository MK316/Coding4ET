# Lesson 4 Data types

Python has several built-in data types that are commonly used. Here's a brief overview of each:

**Note:** We will be focusing on **Numbers, Strings, List, and Dictionary** data types for our purpos.


###1. **Numbers:**

    * Integers (**int**): Whole numbers like 3, 100, -1.
    * Floating-point numbers (**float**): Numbers with a decimal point like 2.3, -0.1, 3.14.
    * Complex numbers (complex): Numbers with a real and imaginary part, e.g., 3 + 4j.

###2. **Strings (str):** Textual data enclosed in single ('...'), double ("..."), or triple quotes ('''...''' or """..."""). For example, "Hello", 'Python'.

###3. Boolean (bool): Represents truth values. The two boolean values are True and False.

###4. **List (list):** An ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items. Lists are defined with square brackets, e.g., [1, 2, 3] or ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'].

###5. Tuple (tuple): An ordered, immutable collection of items. Tuples are defined with parentheses, e.g., (1, 2, 3) or ('a', 'b', 'c').

###6. Set (set): An unordered collection of unique items. Sets are defined with curly braces, e.g., {1, 2, 3} or {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}. Note that sets do not allow duplicate elements.

###7. **Dictionary (dict):** A collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are defined with curly braces containing key-value pairs separated by colons, e.g., {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}.

###8. NoneType (None): A special type representing the absence of a value or a null value.

Each data type serves a specific purpose and can be used in different scenarios in Python programming. For instance, lists and tuples are great for storing ordered collections of items, dictionaries are ideal for storing related data as key-value pairs, and sets are useful for storing unique items and performing set operations.
