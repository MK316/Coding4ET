# Lesson 2 Getting Ready


**Online platforms**

We will use **Google Colab**, an online coding platform, to code, and **Github** to save and share coding projects.

+ 2.2 Colab
+ 2.3 Markdown


## 2.1 Github

### [Github link](https://github.com)

: GitHub is an online platform where you can **store, share, and manage** your coding projects. It's like a library for code. You can think of it as a collaborative space where multiple people can work on the same project from different places. It keeps track of all the changes made to the code, so you can always go back to an earlier version if needed. This is helpful for team projects or when you want feedback on your work. Plus, you can explore and use code shared by others, which can be a great learning resource. GitHub is widely used by programmers, but it is also useful for anyone working on projects that involve coding, including those in the humanities.

🐣Open your account on Github

* Visit the website: [https://github.com](https://github.com)
* Create your account ID: e.g., MK316 (with your Google account)
* Your site: github.com/*youraccountID*   e.g., [https://github.com/*MK316*](https://github.com/MK316)
* Create a repository named 'Spring2025' with Readme.md file (see images below)

🔘 Step 01: For example, click **'repositories'** and **'new'** after logging on the account MK316

🔘 Step 2: Then, write the name for the new repository (e.g., Spring2025/).

Notes:   

1. A slash after the name signifies that it is a repository, analogous to a folder.  
2. Make the repository 'public' so that your project can be visible to anyone with the link.  
3. Check 'Add a README file.' This action creates a readme.md file in the repository. You can later edit this file to display necessary information, similar to a web blog page.

## 2.2 Colab

### [Colab link](https://colab.google/)

: Colab, short for Google Colab, is an online tool that lets you **write and run Python code through your browser**. It is like a digital notebook that you can use for coding. The great thing about Colab is that it provides free access to powerful computing resources, which means you can work on more complex projects without needing a high-end computer. It is particularly handy for data analysis, machine learning projects, and any kind of Python programming.

For humanities students, Colab can be a friendly platform to start experimenting with Python. You can write code, add notes, and even collaborate with others in real-time, much like working on a Google Doc. It is a useful tool for learning to code, working on group projects, or just experimenting with new ideas in a straightforward and accessible way.

### 🐣 Online coding platform (Google Colab)

* Visit [https://colab.google/](https://colab.google/)
* In Google Colab, there are primarily two types of cells: Code cells and Text (Markdown) cells.

**1. In the image above, there are a couple of key things to notice about using Colab:**

**File Name (Untitled48.ipynb):** At the top, you see 'Untitled48.ipynb' which is the name of the notebook you're working on. Just like a physical notebook doesn't have a name until you write one on it, this is a digital notebook that hasn't been named yet. The '48' is just a number to tell it apart from other unnamed notebooks. The '.ipynb' part is like saying "this is a notebook for writing code."

**Adding Cells:** Below the name, you see two buttons, '+ Code' and '+ Text'. These are for adding new sections or "cells" to your notebook. If you want to write some code, you click '+ Code', and a new box will appear where you can type your computer commands. If you want to write some explanations or notes, you click '+ Text', and you'll get a box where you can type regular text.

This is how you build your notebook, by adding cells of code or text to do your work and explain what you're doing. It's like a mix-and-match of doing and explaining, all in one place.

* **Code Cells:** These are the cells where you write and execute programming code. In Colab, which primarily supports Python, you can input Python code and run it directly in the browser. The code cells allow for interactive coding - you write code, run it, and see the output immediately below the cell. This is ideal for data analysis, machine learning, and any other Python-based programming tasks. You can also install libraries, load data, and visualize data in these cells.

* **Text (Markdown[^1]) Cells:** These cells are used for adding text, formatted using Markdown, to your notebook. Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to format text using plain text syntax. In these cells, you can add headings, lists, links, images, and even HTML elements to document your analysis, provide instructions, or add explanations and context to your code. This is very useful for creating a comprehensive, well-documented, and easy-to-understand notebook.

Colab's combination of these two cell types allows for a mix of narrative, code, and output, making it a powerful tool for interactive programming and data analysis.

**Note:** When you hover the mouse cursor in the middle of the top or bottom of a cell (e.g., in the given image, the cursor is placed at the bottom of the given cell), options for '+ Code' and '+ Text' appear. By selecting one of these, you can add a new cell either above or below the current one.


**2. Saving a copy of your notebook to Github** 

- Find 'File' button on the top menu.
- Click 'Save a copy in Github' (if this doesn't show, find 'Save a copy in Github Gist' > then save the file again to Github)
- In a saving pop-up window, check 'Repository' and the file name.
- Click 'OK' > Then the file will reopen in your Github. (If this doesn't happen, the file isn't saved correctly.)
- Visit your Github account and see whether it is saved in the designated place.
