# Practice Exercise Questions
Below are five practice exercises designed to reinforce the concepts covered in the beginner and intermediate manuals. These exercises use language learning data as examples. Try to solve them on your own before checking the answer keys.

# Exercise 1: Reading and Displaying Data

+ Question: You have a CSV file named "language_progress.csv" that tracks the progress of students learning a new language. It contains columns for "Student Name", "Language", "Month", and "Score". Write the code to read this CSV file into a DataFrame and display the first 10 rows.

# Exercise 2: Filtering Data

+ Question: From the "language_progress.csv" DataFrame, filter out the data to show only the records of students learning "Spanish".

# Exercise 3: Handling Missing Values

+ Question: Assume some scores are missing in the "Score" column of your "language_progress.csv" DataFrame. Write a code snippet to fill these missing values with the average score of the entire column.

# Exercise 4: Basic Data Analysis

+ Question: Calculate the average score for each language and display the results. Use the "language_progress.csv" DataFrame for this exercise.

# Exercise 5: Data Visualization

+ Question: Visualize the count of students learning each language using a bar chart. Assume your DataFrame from "language_progress.csv" has a "Language" column.
