## Overview

🐾 **The focus of this manual and goals**

In today's era of digital technology deeply intertwined with education, the importance of digital literacy in English teaching is increasingly recognized. 

* The current scope of digital literacy extends beyond merely using media tools in the classroom. It now encompasses an understanding of basic coding to effectively integrate various generative AI tools into teaching practices. 

* Language educators, often trained in the humanities, may find the concept of coding unfamiliar and challenging to approach. Our goal is not to require educators to master coding or create new codes, but rather to develop the ability to read and understand code at a basic level. 

* This understanding enables them to utilize generative AI tools like ChatGPT to create more effective language learning tools tailored to learners' levels and educational content. 

Therefore, this manual aims to introduce Python coding in a fundamental way, focusing on codes related to language learning.

## Lesson 1 Introduction
**1. What is Python?**

Python is a **high-level programming language** known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for beginners as well as experienced developers. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes **code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.**

* High-level programming language (cf. Low-level programming language) - A high-level programming language is user-friendly, using natural language elements, making it easier to learn and write code compared to more complex, low-level languages.

* Using whitespace? (Examples below)
