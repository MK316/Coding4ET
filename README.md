## Acknowledgments

1. This manual is written to be used as teaching material for improving digital literacy among future and current teachers of English, aiming to provide an easier approach to basic Python coding.

2. This manual will continue to be updated and revised for the progress of the course.

3. ChatGPT 4.0 was used to rewrite the text for readability, check for English grammar, and create examples.

## Overview

üêæ **The focus of this manual and goals**

In today's era of digital technology deeply intertwined with education, the importance of digital literacy in English teaching is increasingly recognized. 

* The current scope of digital literacy extends beyond merely using media tools in the classroom. It now encompasses an understanding of basic coding to effectively integrate various generative AI tools into teaching practices. 

* Language educators, often trained in the humanities, may find the concept of coding unfamiliar and challenging to approach. Our goal is not to require educators to master coding or create new codes, but rather to develop the ability to read and understand code at a basic level. 

* This understanding enables them to utilize generative AI tools like ChatGPT to create more effective language learning tools tailored to learners' levels and educational content. 

Therefore, this manual aims to introduce Python coding in a fundamental way, focusing on codes related to language learning.

## Lesson 1 Introduction
**1. What is Python?**

Python is a **high-level programming language** known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for beginners as well as experienced developers. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes **code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.**

* High-level programming language (cf. Low-level programming language) - A high-level programming language is user-friendly, using natural language elements, making it easier to learn and write code compared to more complex, low-level languages.

* Using whitespace? (Examples below)

## Lesson 2 Getting Ready

**Online platforms**

We will use an online platform to code in the Python language (**Colab**) and to save and share the code (**Github**).

1. [Github](https://github.com)

: GitHub is an online platform where you can **store, share, and manage** your coding projects. It's like a library for code. You can think of it as a collaborative space where multiple people can work on the same project from different places. It keeps track of all the changes made to the code, so you can always go back to an earlier version if needed. This is helpful for team projects or when you want feedback on your work. Plus, you can explore and use code shared by others, which can be a great learning resource. GitHub is widely used by programmers, but it is also useful for anyone working on projects that involve coding, including those in the humanities.


2. [Colab](https://colab.google/)

: Colab, short for Google Colab, is an online tool that lets you **write and run Python code through your browser**. It is like a digital notebook that you can use for coding. The great thing about Colab is that it provides free access to powerful computing resources, which means you can work on more complex projects without needing a high-end computer. It is particularly handy for data analysis, machine learning projects, and any kind of Python programming.

For humanities students, Colab can be a friendly platform to start experimenting with Python. You can write code, add notes, and even collaborate with others in real-time, much like working on a Google Doc. It is a useful tool for learning to code, working on group projects, or just experimenting with new ideas in a straightforward and accessible way.

2.1 Github
### Github
üê£Open your account on Github

* Visit the website: [https://github.com](https://github.com)
* Create your account ID: e.g., MK316 (with your Google account)
* Your site: github.com/*youraccountID*   e.g., [https://github.com/*MK316*](https://github.com/MK316)
* Create a repository named 'Spring2024' with Readme.md file (see images below)

üîò Step 01: For example, click **'repositories'** and **'new'** after logging on the account MK316

üîò Step 2: Then, write the name for the new repository (e.g., Spring2024/).

Notes:   

1. A slash after the name signifies that it is a repository, analogous to a folder.  
2. Make the repository 'public' so that your project can be visible to anyone with the link.  
3. Check 'Add a README file.' This action creates a readme.md file in the repository. You can later edit this file to display necessary information, similar to a web blog page.
