## Acknowledgment
📢[Audio](https://mrkim21.github.io/manual/audio.html)
1. This manual is written to be used as teaching material for improving digital literacy among future and current teachers of English, aiming to provide an easier approach to basic Python coding.
2. This manual will continue to be updated and revised for the progress of the course.
3. ChatGPT 4.0 was used to rewrite the text for readability, check for English grammar, and create examples.

   
## Overview

🌱 **The focus of this manual and goals**

In today's era of digital technology deeply intertwined with education, the importance of digital literacy in English teaching is increasingly recognized. 

* The current scope of digital literacy extends beyond merely using media tools in the classroom. It now encompasses an understanding of basic coding to effectively integrate various generative AI tools into teaching practices. 

* Language educators, often trained in the humanities, may find the concept of coding unfamiliar and challenging to approach. Our goal is not to require educators to master coding or create new codes, but rather to develop the ability to read and understand code at a basic level. 

* This understanding enables them to utilize generative AI tools like ChatGPT to create more effective language learning tools tailored to learners' levels and educational content. 

Therefore, this manual aims to introduce Python coding in a fundamental way, focusing on codes related to language learning and teaching.
