## Overview

🐾 **The focus of this manual and goals**

In today's era of digital technology deeply intertwined with education, the importance of digital literacy in English teaching is increasingly recognized. 

* The current scope of digital literacy extends beyond merely using media tools in the classroom. It now encompasses an understanding of basic coding to effectively integrate various generative AI tools into teaching practices. 

* Language educators, often trained in the humanities, may find the concept of coding unfamiliar and challenging to approach. Our goal is not to require educators to master coding or create new codes, but rather to develop the ability to read and understand code at a basic level. 

* This understanding enables them to utilize generative AI tools like ChatGPT to create more effective language learning tools tailored to learners' levels and educational content. 

Therefore, this manual aims to introduce Python coding in a fundamental way, focusing on codes related to language learning.

## Lesson 1 Introduction
**1. What is Python?**

Python is a **high-level programming language** known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for beginners as well as experienced developers. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes **code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.**

* High-level programming language (cf. Low-level programming language) - A high-level programming language is user-friendly, using natural language elements, making it easier to learn and write code compared to more complex, low-level languages.
* [Guido van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/)
* Using whitespace? (Examples below)

## Lesson 2 Getting Ready

**Online platforms**

We will use an online platform to code in the Python language (**Colab**) and to save and share the code (**Github**).

1. [Github](https://github.com)

: GitHub is an online platform where you can **store, share, and manage** your coding projects. It's like a library for code. You can think of it as a collaborative space where multiple people can work on the same project from different places. It keeps track of all the changes made to the code, so you can always go back to an earlier version if needed. This is helpful for team projects or when you want feedback on your work. Plus, you can explore and use code shared by others, which can be a great learning resource. GitHub is widely used by programmers, but it is also useful for anyone working on projects that involve coding, including those in the humanities.


2. [Colab](https://colab.google/)

: Colab, short for Google Colab, is an online tool that lets you **write and run Python code through your browser**. It is like a digital notebook that you can use for coding. The great thing about Colab is that it provides free access to powerful computing resources, which means you can work on more complex projects without needing a high-end computer. It is particularly handy for data analysis, machine learning projects, and any kind of Python programming.

For humanities students, Colab can be a friendly platform to start experimenting with Python. You can write code, add notes, and even collaborate with others in real-time, much like working on a Google Doc. It is a useful tool for learning to code, working on group projects, or just experimenting with new ideas in a straightforward and accessible way.

## Github
2.1 Github

🐣Open your account on Github

* Visit the website: [https://github.com](https://github.com)
* Create your account ID: e.g., MK316 (with your Google account)
* Your site: github.com/*youraccountID*   e.g., [https://github.com/*MK316*](https://github.com/MK316)
* Create a repository named 'Spring2024' with Readme.md file (see images below)

🔘 Step 01: For example, click **'repositories'** and **'new'** after logging on the account MK316

![](https://github.com/MK316/Coding4ET/raw/main/images/image01.png)

🔘 Step 2: Then, write the name for the new repository (e.g., Spring2024/).

Notes:   

1. A slash after the name signifies that it is a repository, analogous to a folder.  
2. Make the repository 'public' so that your project can be visible to anyone with the link.  
3. Check 'Add a README file.' This action creates a readme.md file in the repository. You can later edit this file to display necessary information, similar to a web blog page.

## Colab
2.2 Colab

🐣 Online coding platform (Google Colab)

* Visit [https://colab.google/](https://colab.google/)
* In Google Colab, there are primarily two types of cells: Code cells and Text (Markdown) cells.

![](https://github.com/MK316/Coding4ET/raw/main/images/image03.png)


![](https://github.com/MK316/Coding4ET/raw/main/images/image04.png)

**1. In the image above, there are a couple of key things to notice about using Colab:**

**File Name (Untitled48.ipynb):** At the top, you see 'Untitled48.ipynb' which is the name of the notebook you're working on. Just like a physical notebook doesn't have a name until you write one on it, this is a digital notebook that hasn't been named yet. The '48' is just a number to tell it apart from other unnamed notebooks. The '.ipynb' part is like saying "this is a notebook for writing code."

**Adding Cells:** Below the name, you see two buttons, '+ Code' and '+ Text'. These are for adding new sections or "cells" to your notebook. If you want to write some code, you click '+ Code', and a new box will appear where you can type your computer commands. If you want to write some explanations or notes, you click '+ Text', and you'll get a box where you can type regular text.

This is how you build your notebook, by adding cells of code or text to do your work and explain what you're doing. It's like a mix-and-match of doing and explaining, all in one place.

* **Code Cells:** These are the cells where you write and execute programming code. In Colab, which primarily supports Python, you can input Python code and run it directly in the browser. The code cells allow for interactive coding - you write code, run it, and see the output immediately below the cell. This is ideal for data analysis, machine learning, and any other Python-based programming tasks. You can also install libraries, load data, and visualize data in these cells.

* **Text (Markdown[^1]) Cells:** These cells are used for adding text, formatted using Markdown, to your notebook. Markdown is a simple markup language that allows you to format text using plain text syntax. In these cells, you can add headings, lists, links, images, and even HTML elements to document your analysis, provide instructions, or add explanations and context to your code. This is very useful for creating a comprehensive, well-documented, and easy-to-understand notebook.

Colab's combination of these two cell types allows for a mix of narrative, code, and output, making it a powerful tool for interactive programming and data analysis.

**Note:** When you hover the mouse cursor in the middle of the top or bottom of a cell (e.g., in the given image, the cursor is placed at the bottom of the given cell), options for '+ Code' and '+ Text' appear. By selecting one of these, you can add a new cell either above or below the current one.

## Markdown
2.3 Markdown

🐣 Practice on your README.md file

This is the file you've made when you created a repository (Remember checking 'Add a README file')

* Go to your Github account and Sign in (with your Google account)
* Go to the repository 'Spring2024' > README.md
* You can see an edit icon on the page (see below)

![](https://github.com/MK316/Coding4ET/raw/main/images/image05.png)

**Note:** You will learn about the Markdown language bit by bit as necessary when relevant topics come up. For now, let's just briefly introduce what the Markdown language and README files (with the .md extension) are, and practice that.

**📍Instruction: Try the following conventions in your README.md file.**

If you follow 1 & 2, then you'll see 3 on the right.

![](https://github.com/MK316/Coding4ET/raw/main/images/image06.png)

Examples (below):

## Heading Level 1 (Biggest Size)

To create the biggest heading, you use one hash symbol (#) followed by a space, and then your heading text.

## Heading Level 2 (Second Biggest Size)

For a slightly smaller heading, use two hash symbols (##) followed by a space.

### Heading Level 3 (Medium Size)

Use three hash symbols (###) for an even smaller heading.

[^1]: **Markdown (or Markdown language)** is a simple way of writing formatted text using plain text. It's popular because it's easy to learn and use. Imagine you're writing a normal text document, but you can also add some special symbols to make certain words bold, create lists, or even add links and pictures.

For example, if you want to make a word bold, you wrap it in double asterisks, like this: **bold**. If you want to create a list, you just start lines with dashes or numbers. And to add a link, you put the text you want to show in square brackets and the web address in parentheses right after it.

The great thing about Markdown is that it's meant to be as easy to read in its plain text form as it is in its formatted form. It's widely used in many websites and tools, like GitHub and Reddit, for writing comments, instructions, and more. For beginners, it's a friendly way to start adding some style to your text without needing to know any complex coding or web design techniques.
